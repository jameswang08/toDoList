Overview of project:
-To do list that allows user to create tasks they need to complete, with options to set a task name, priority, date, and provide a description
-Ability to create new projects that have their own tasks and switch between projects
-Data is stored locally, so even if the page is reloaded, user will not lose their projects/tasks

What I learned from doing this project:
-How to use webpack and npm
-Importing and exporting modules
-How to use a .gitignore file
-How to use a browser's local storage

*Note: I didn't implement some things, such as better styling, the option to remove projects (because I felt that I had already learned the reasoning behind this when I implemeneted the option to remove tasks), etc... so that I could continue learning more.

-A bug I haven't fixed yet, for this same reason, is that projects and tasks may be restored in a different order, after the page has been reloaded or opened/closed
