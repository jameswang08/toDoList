What I learned from doing this project:
-How to use webpack and npm
-Importing and exporting modules
-How to use a .gitignore file
-How to use a browser's local storage

*Note: I didn't implement some things, such as better styling, the option to remove projects (because I felt that I had already learned the reasoning behind this when I implemeneted the option to remove tasks), etc... so that I could continue learning more.

-A bug I haven't fixed yet, for this same reason, is that projects and tasks may be restored in a different order, after the page has been reloaded or opened/closed
